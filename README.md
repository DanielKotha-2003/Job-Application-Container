## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher.
-   A Supabase account and project.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-application-tracker.git
    cd job-application-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**

    -   Create a new project in Supabase.
    -   Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the table:

    ```sql
    create table job_applications (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
      company_name text not null,
      role text not null,
      status text check (status in ('Applied', 'Accepted', 'Withdrawn', 'Rejected')) not null,
      resume_url text,
      applied_date text -- Storing ISO format date string from Python
    );
    ```

    -   Create a storage bucket named `resumes` and make it public.

4.  **Configure Credentials:**

    Create a file named `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in the project root and add your Supabase URL and Key:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url"
    SUPABASE_KEY = "your-supabase-anon-key"
    ```

5.  **Add Background Video:**
    
    Ensure you have a `background.mp4` file in the root directory for the animated background.

streamlit run app.py
```
